        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p className="lead">
          This large app consists of two parts. Front-end and back-end
          respectively.
          <br />
          Let's start with the UI part. We have carefully designed and coded
          pages.
          <br />
          With help of NextJS, we are now able to send server-side rendered code
          to the end-user and thus have <strong>SEO-friendly</strong> website.
          <br />
          There is an SEO module in this project, <strong>SEO</strong> content
          can be added and edited by the content manager.
          <br />
          A lot of stuff going on in the admin panel:
          <br />
          <br />
          1) Tables with real backend data, you can preview content without
          opening the view page. Also, you can filter by date.
          <br />
          2) View page where you can see all the fields with or without values
          for a certain entity e.g. product.
          <br />
          3) Edit page is mostly the same as View, but there you can save
          changes.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>So let's go over the admin side</h2>
          Nice and clean Home page with charts, statistics, and tabs widget.
          <br />
          Orders tab is a list of orders that you can filter, view, and edit
          <br />
          Feedback is a great thing for online business and we added
          full-featured feedback to this project, you can view and moderate
          feedback, wow!
          <br />
          <br />
          The blog is a small <strong>ready-made CMS</strong>, you can create
          blog posts with a bunch of dynamic data and multiple images just give
          it a try!
          <br />
          <br />
          <img
            className="img-responsive w-100 border mt-4 mb-4"
            src={blogScreenshot}
            alt="screenshot"
          />
          <br />
          <strong>Products</strong> are heart of every e-commerce project you
          can set price, image, category for filtering, discount, and much more
          <br />
          <br />
          Users is a place where all you customers are at a glance.
          <br />
          <br />
          <img
            className="img-responsive w-100 border mt-4 mb-4"
            src={usersScreenshot}
            alt="screenshot"
          />
          <br />
          Categories are mostly used for filtering so-called helper for you
          business.
          <br />
          My profile serves admin and customer to view their data and change it
          if needed.
          <br />
          Change password speaks for itself.
          <br />
          <img
            className="img-responsive w-100 border mt-4 mb-4"
            src={passwordScreenshot}
            alt="screenshot"
          />
          Documentation is designed to help you learn all about this template.
          <br />
          Client-side is accessible for everyone and you can explore it just by
          clicking here and there, all the pages are mobile and{" "}
          <strong>SEO friendly</strong>

          Check out the billing page, it has stripe integration so you can test
          it out and also easily change stripe credentials so payment setup is
          going to be effortless.
          <br />
          <br />
          There is a wishlist where you can see desired products and purchase at
          some point in time. And much more, explore the template and make a

          <h2>
            Let's talk about what's going on under the hood and I mean backend.
          </h2>
          <br />
          It's built with help of the express js framework. We use Postgres as a
          database and squelize serves as ORM. There were two reasons why we
          picked this stack. First of all, community, clear documentation, and a
          lot of open-source libraries. Second of all, we are experts with this
          technology.
          <br />
          <br />
          So what is inside?
          <br />
          <br />
          The first thing I want to mention is the passport.js library for
          authentication. Simple, unobtrusive authentication that became
          standard in the <strong>NodeJS</strong> world. For password encryption
          we used bcrypt. In db api folder we have all the necessary files with{" "}
          <strong>CRUD</strong> methods to interact with DB.
          <br />
          <br />
          Models are just data objects that clearly showcase what kind of data
          we can anticipate for each entity.
          <br />
          <br />
          Seeders are a heap of sample data that is added to the web app by
          default with help of yarn reset.
          <br />
          <br />
          In <code>db.config</code> you can configure your database credentials
          for development and production.
          <br />
          <br />
          Routes have files with all available routes and you can see that
          particular routes have passport middleware and some do not, this is a
          great feature if you need certain routes to be reachable by authorized
          users and unauthorized.
          <br />
          <br />
          Services are made following an abstraction pattern. Basically, service
          imports methods from the api and gives you a nice and clean way to
          harness <strong>CRUD</strong> functionality and have readable and
          clean code, enjoy!
          <br />
          <br />
          Config has all the configurations, just update the values and your
          config is ready, as simple as that.
          <br />
          <br />
          All magic happens at the Index file, this is where your node js app
          starts!
          <br />
          <br />
          I believe you will find a lot of new interesting code and development
          practices exploring source code. The file uploading module is really
          powerful and important for every app. After you got a gist of this
          code it will be extremely easy for you to add new routes and enhance
          functionality. The code is readable and even if you don't have a great
          experience with node and expressjs you will be able to make full use
          of it.
          <br />
          Good Luck!
